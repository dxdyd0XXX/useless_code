# useless_code

when you try to overload python program with functions: 
overloading: naming many programs with the same name but setting them to do different work, to put it simply.

you can't do it directly in python. 
first, I'm kinda stuck what u tryna do here. 
*So* : 
first: (assuming that you want to user to choose between functions)
   *you're program is simple and differs only on the operation being performed at it. so I'm gonna create a simple operator selection first*
